### Backend Developer | Open Source Enthusiast 

I am a passionate backend developer from India. I'm currently studying Computer Engineering at Aligarh Muslim University. My love for technology and innovation drives me to constantly learn and create, especially in the realm of open source software.

### Current Endeavors

- **GSoC '24 with FOSSology:** I'm thrilled to have been selected for Google Summer of Code 2024 with FOSSology. My project focuses on integrating FOSSology scanners into CI pipelines, enhancing the software compliance process. Checkout my project [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/by86kI7T)

### Interests and Activities

- **Backend Development:** Backend development is my forte. I enjoy building robust and scalable systems that solve real-world problems. My core tech stack is Python. Nowadays, I am learning Go because of it's fast nature and built in concurrency. 
- **Open Source Software:** I actively create and contribute to open source projects. I believe in the power of collaborative development and the freedom it brings to software creation.
- **Hackathons and Conferences:** I love participating in hackathons and attending conferences and talks about programming and software. Recently, I attended PyDelhi, which was an incredible experience.
- **Community Building:** I co-founded an open source community at my college called **ZHCET Code Oasis**. Our mission is to foster a culture of open source contribution and collaboration among students.

## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ayushi Gupta  
Computer Engineering student at Aligarh Muslim University, passionate about Backend Development and AI systems.

##  <span style="color:gray;">About Me</span>  

I am **Ayushi Gupta**, currently in my final year of **Computer Engineering** at Aligarh Muslim University. I am passionate about **backend development**, **AI**, and building scalable software systems. Over the past few years, I have gained hands on experience through internships and projects involving **Spring Boot**, **microservices**, **machine learning**, and **deep learning**. I love solving challenging problems, learning new technologies, and turning ideas into real-world applications. Outside of coding, I actively participate in competitive programming and tech communities to sharpen my skills and help others grow.  
I have **6+ months of experience** in the software development domain and have completed internships as:  

- **SDE Intern** at <a href="#infoglen" style="color:#1E90FF;">Infoglen</a>  
- **AI Intern** at <a href="#iit-madras" style="color:#1E90FF;">IIT-Madras</a>  
- **AI Intern** at <a href="#iit-hyderabad" style="color:#1E90FF;">IIT-Hyderabad</a>

## <span style="color:gray;">Professional Experience</span>  

- **<span style="color:darkcyan;" id="iit-madras">IIT Madras</span>**:
<div style="margin-left:50px;">I developed a deep learning model to generate <strong>Radio Environment Maps</strong> (REMs), which are spatial representations of wireless signal strength across an indoor area. These maps are crucial for understanding how radio signals propagate in complex environments and for planning efficient network deployments. My model not only produced highly accurate REMs but also suggested <strong>optimal Access Point (AP) placements</strong> to maximize signal coverage, even in the presence of obstacles and varying transmitter positions using just indoor layout of the environment. With a <strong>median prediction error of less than 3.5 dB</strong>, the system provided reliable and precise insights for indoor wireless network optimization.

</div>  

- **<span style="color:darkcyan;" id="iit-hyderabad">IIT Hyderabad</span>**:
<div style="margin-left:50px;"> I worked on building a Full-fledged prototype of an <strong>Unmanned Ground Vehicle</strong> (UGV),a robotic vehicle designed to operate on the ground without direct human control, under the guidance of Prof. Krishna Mohan. My focus was working on <strong?>autonomous navigation</strong> of UGV, enabling it to sense its surroundings, and make navigation decisions on its own. To improve the vehicleâ€™s decision-making, I developed a <strong>Graph Neural Network</strong> (GNN)-based adaptive path planning algorithm, which was trained on LiDAR point cloud data. This approach significantly enhanced the accuracy of navigation, <strong>achieving an 85% improvement</strong> in path planning performance compared to traditional methods.

</div>  


- **<span style="color:darkcyan;" id="infoglen">Infoglen</span>**:
<div style="margin-left:50px;">I gained hands-on experience with <strong>Salesforce CRM</strong>, working extensively on the object model and lead lifecycle management. My role involved building <strong>process automations</strong> using <strong>Flows, Process Builder, Apex (classes and triggers), SOQL, and DML</strong>, while adhering to best practices. I also worked with Lightning App Builder, Aura Components, and Lightning Web Components (LWCs), gaining exposure to deployment strategies across environments. Additionally, I developed <strong>automation utilities</strong> and streamlined workflows using Apex (a Java-like programming language), which significantly improved lead generation processes. By <strong>optimizing database operations</strong> with SQL query aggregation, I was able to <strong>reduce system load by 40%</strong> and <strong>enhance overall performance by 60%</strong>.</div>

## <span style="color:gray;">Projects</span>
- **<span style="color:darkcyan;">LinkClippr</span>**: 
<div style="margin-left:50px;">I developed a <strong>Full-stack</strong> URL shortener application that makes it easy to shorten, manage, and share links. The <strong>backend</strong> was built with </strong>Spring Boot</strong>, the frontend with React + Vite, and the application used a PostgreSQL database for storage. To ensure secure access, I implemented <strong>JWT authentication</strong> with </strong>Spring Security</strong>, along with features like </strong>subdomain redirects</strong> through domain aliasing and detailed URL and date based analytics displayed on a user-friendly dashboard. For deployment, I Dockerized the backend and hosted it on Render, while the frontend was deployed on a custom domain via Netlify, with the database running on a cloud-hosted PostgreSQL instance (NeonDB).<br>

- **<span style="color:darkcyan;">Fit-Meter</span>**:
<div style="margin-left:50px;">I built a <strong>backend microservices-based fitness tracker application</strong> using <strong>Spring Boot</strong>, designed to track user activities and provide personalized analysis and recommendations through the <strong>Gemini API</strong>. The system is composed of <strong>independent services</strong> for users, activities, and AI-based recommendations, all managed via <strong>Eureka Server</strong> and communicating seamlessly through <strong>Spring WebClient</strong>. To handle </strong>asynchronous interactions</strong> between the activity and recommendation services, I incorporate <strong>RabbitMQ</strong>, ensuring smooth and reliable message delivery. The application also integrates </strong>OAuth2 with PKCE</strong> using <strong>Keycloak</strong>, providing secure authentication and authorization for all users.

</div>

- **<span style="color:darkcyan;">CNN Based Malaria Diagnosis</span>**:
<div style="margin-left:50px;">I developed a <strong>LeNet-based CNN</strong> to classify blood smear images as parasitized or uninfected, <strong>achieving 94% accuracy</strong>. Using both TensorFlowâ€™s functional and sequential APIs, I built custom layers and optimized key metrics such as <strong>ROC</strong> and <strong>specificity</strong>. I also streamlined data loading, preprocessing, and batch handling for large image datasets using TensorFlowâ€™s Datasets API, ensuring efficient and scalable model training.

</div>

- **<span style="color:darkcyan;">Gemini Bot</span>**:
<div style="margin-left:50px;">I developed an <strong>AI powered chatbot</strong> that uses <strong>Gemini API</strong> to provide intelligent, real time responses and enhance user interactions. The application features a <strong>Spring Boot backend</strong> for handling API requests and a React + Vite frontend for a responsive, interactive interface. Using Docker, the system is fully containerized and scalable, delivering smooth API integration, efficient backend processing, and a seamless user experience.
