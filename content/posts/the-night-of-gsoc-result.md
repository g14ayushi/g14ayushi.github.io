Currently, it is 3 in the morning on the of 2nd May 2024. I am writing this with a plethora of emotions rushing through my body. I have been accepted as a GSoC contributor for Fossology. I‚Äôll be working on the FOssology CI Scanner Image project over the summer.

I am relieved that the day has finally arrived and for the better, excited to look forward to what is going to happen next, and a little scared too. I have felt like waiting forever for this moment. From the first time I heard about GSoC from my brother, I imagined this day in every way possible. But now when the day has finally arrived, I feel overwhelmed and kind of frozen.

I still remember last year during the same time, I was sulking in front of my brother because my proposal had been rejected. That night, he told me one very important thing that has stayed with me all this time and will probably stay with me for the rest of my life, that ‚Äúcongratulate yourself on your failure, you tried and failed, that is the reason you are sad. If you hadn‚Äôt tried, you would never have known this emotion.‚Äù

I also feel thankful to my parents, because they are there for me every day from day till night. My mother was the first person I told about the result and she was way happier and expressive than me. She has been my rock for all my life.

The self doubts and lack of motivation is something that I have had to deal with a lot in the past few years, but one thing that I have learned in all this time is to keep going, not worrying about the outcome and enjoying the process. Looking forward to new experiences and new challenges.
I hope to catch you soon!
